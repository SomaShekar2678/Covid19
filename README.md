# Covid19 Forecasting
This project focuses on analyzing the impact of COVID-19, visualizing the rate of infection and recovery, and predicting future cases using time series models. The project utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas, Plotly, and Facebook Prophet.
Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, visualizes trends in infection and recovery rates, and makes predictions about future cases based on current trends. The main technologies used in this project include:

Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
Plotly for interactive visualizations
Facebook Prophet for time series forecasting
Data
The dataset used in this project contains information about COVID-19 patients, including the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. The data is accumulated from multiple data files and is preprocessed for analysis and visualization.
Usage
Load and Preprocess Data: Load the COVID-19 data using Pandas and preprocess it to extract relevant information.
Visualize Data: Create interactive visualizations of infection and recovery rates using Plotly.
Make Predictions: Use Facebook Prophet to build time series models and make predictions about future cases.
Combine Visualizations: Combine the visualizations for a comprehensive view of the trends and predictions.
Visualization
The project provides interactive visualizations using Plotly:

Confirmed COVID-19 cases over time
Recovered COVID-19 cases over time
Combined visualization of confirmed, recovered, and predicted cases

Prediction
The project uses Facebook Prophet to create time series models for predicting future COVID-19 cases. The model is trained on historical data and provides forecasts for the number of cases expected in the near future.
